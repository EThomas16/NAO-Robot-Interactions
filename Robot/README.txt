robot_run_me can be run to open a GUI with the different commands for the robot, including:
	gesture recognition - allows the robot to mimic a gesture the user is performing
	voice commands - recognises preset commands, these can be seen in the voice_commands.txt file in this directory
ensure that the paths are correct when running. On the Windows 7 computer the path is set up to run from the D:/Erik_Thomas folder.
